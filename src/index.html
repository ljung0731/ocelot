            An <strong>ocelot</strong> is a wild cat, and its scientific name is Leopardus pardalis
            wich means <dfn>“like a leopard”</dfn>. Its average size is roughly 40 to 50 cm at
            shoulders and the weight is between 6.6 and 15.5kg. The life expectancy of an ocelot is
            15.7 years, but it can live up to 20 years. It's founded in the southwestern US, Mexico,
            Central and South America, and the Caribbean islands of Trinidad and Margarita. It is
            the second largest spotted cats in South America. An ocelot is often threatened by
            traffic accidents, illegal fur trade, hunting, and habitant destruction. It is listed as
            least concern on the
            <abbr title="International Union for Conservation of Nature">IUCN</abbr>
            Red List, but its populations are decreasing. Back in the Aztec and Incan civilization,
            ocelots were associated with humans as pets. A famous painter, Salvador Dali, also had
            an ocelot as his pet. It is still legal to have the ocelot as a pet like a house cat in
            some places.

            An ocelot is a medium-sized cat with black or dark brown doughnut-shaped dots with dark
            tan in the middle. The pattern is similar to a leopard. Their coat is very smooth and
            short, about 0.8 cm on the belly area, and 1cm on the back. Ocelots have a few dark
            stripes running through from the back of the neck to tails. They also have markings on
            their cheeks with stripes. Every ocelot has a unique color pattern. Their unique fur
            pattern can be used to identify one other. Ocelots have long ringed tails. The average
            tail length is 10 to 16 inches. An ocelot's weight at birth is around 7 to 12 ounces.
            Females weigh around 6.6 to 11.3kg and males are 8 to 15.5kg.

            Ocelots are found in the southern part of Texas to northern part of Argentina in South
            America. In the US, ocelots are spotted in Texas, Arizona, Louisiana, and Arkansas.
            Ocelots live in tropical forests, thorn forest, mangrove swamps, and savannas. Ocelots
            desires habitats with good availability of water, and prey. Also, this area can be good
            for avoiding predators as well. They like areas with dense forest cover and water. If
            the area is too open space with no tree and bushes, they can't survive, so live to find
            other area to live. They tend to live a far from roads and villages. They also avoid
            steep slopes and highly elevated areas where it's hard to find preys. They normally
            appear at elevations below 1,200 m and have occasionally been recorded up to 3,800 m.
            Ocelots allocate large parts of their ranges with cougar, jaguarundi, jaguar, margay,
            and oncilla.

            Experts say that it is hard to study ocelots because they are active mostly at night,
            especially at dawn and dusk. When it is raining or cloudy in the daytime, they could be
            active in daytime. Ocelots sleep in bushes, on a tree brunch, or inside a hollow tree to
            be hidden from other predators during the daytime. Ocelots spend most of their time on
            the ground, but they can also swim well, climb, and jump high. Ocelots haunt mainly
            small rodents. It habitually preys on animals that weigh less than 1kg. They sometimes
            eat birds, snakes, iguanas, baby deer, rabbits, baby peccaries, and even fish and crabs.
            They tend to look for preys when they are strolling. They walk slowly to search preys.
            Time to time they may sit and wait for preys to appear. They can wait for prey for a
            half hour or even an hour at certain site. Ocelots usually eat prey immediately once
            it's killed, but they remove bird feathers before eating. Ocelots are smart enough to
            save their food. If they can't finish the carcass in one feeding, they cover the food
            and return the next night to finish the food.<br /><br />

            Ocelots can mate any time of the year. However the peak mating seasons of them can be
            vary depending on their locations. For the ocelots in Texas, their mating season is
            typically in October to winter, and for ones in Central America, it is usually in spring
            months. Both male and female ocelots make short and long-range sounds. The gestational
            period of ocelots is 79 days to 85 days. Female ocelots normally give birth in dens
            vegetation area. A newborn kitten weighs around 200g to 340 g. A newborn ocelot has
            black or dark brown spots and stripes on gray background. A mother ocelot stays in the
            den about 13 to 64 days. The color of the fur changes from gray to golden brown as the
            ocelot grows older. Kittens opens their eyes 15 to 18 days after their born. Ocelots
            usually become independent after a year. However, they might stay with their mother for
            one more year. They start disappearing and forming their own territory. They typically
            live about 15.7 years, but it can live up to 20 years.
